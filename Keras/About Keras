What is keras ?
# keras is a high-level interface and uses Theano or Tensorflow for its backend
# It runs smoothly on both CPU and GPU
# Keras supports almost all the models of a deep learning - fully connected,convolution,pooling,recurrent,embedding etc
# keras is a completely Python-based framework,which makes it easy to debug and explore

Why use keras?
# Keras offers consistent and simple APIs
# It has stronger adoption in both the industry and the research community
# Keras makes it easy to turn models into products
# It supports multiple backend engines and does not lock into one ecosystem
# Keras has strong multi-GPU support and distributed training support
